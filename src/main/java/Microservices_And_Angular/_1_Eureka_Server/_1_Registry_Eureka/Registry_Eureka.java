/*                                       Registry:


    1. Service Registration:
                * Microservices register themselves with the Eureka Server when they start up.
                * This information includes details like the
                            - host,
                            - port,
                            - and health indicator URL.

    2. Centralized Information:
                * By having a centralized registry, the system has one source of truth
                            - for the location and status of all microservices.
                * This simplifies configuration and enables dynamic routing.

    3. Dynamic Updates:
                * As services come online,
                * go offline, or change their locations,
        these updates are dynamically reflected in the Eureka registry.
